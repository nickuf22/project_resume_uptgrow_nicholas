# Resources

    * I used this site to find jQuery plugins that would be applicable to my site.
    * I specifically used 5 (GoUp) and 45 (Elevate Zoom). GoUp provides an arrow in a black box on the righthand corner that takes you back to the top of the page when you are scrolling down. Elevate Zoom allows you to zoom in on images and, in this case, that would be the picture of me.

# Deductions
- I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
* My custom jQuery code removes the image when you click it in order to save space as you scroll.
* Also, when it shifts to the desktop view, I wanted the footer to appear inline but whenever I would use floats with the classes, the footer would disappear altogether.
